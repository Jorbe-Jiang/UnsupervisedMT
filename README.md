Unsupervised Machine Translation Model for data augmentation

The Unsupervised Machine Translation Model is discribed in the paper published at ICLR2018 by FAIR
[“Unsupervised Machine Translation Using Monolingual Corpora Only”](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00043.pdf)

This repo is an implemention of the unsupervised machine translation model with tensorflow1.3
